# CNN-On-FPGA
This is the code of the CNN on FPGA.But this can only be used for reference at present for some files are write coarsly using ISE.

The ordinary project developed using VIVADO is on another computer and I can't use it because of the SARS-CoV-2.

I will then perfect it as soon as possible.
