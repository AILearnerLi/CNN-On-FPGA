# CNN-On-FPGA
This is the code of the paper 
        "Acceleration of FPGA Based Convolutional Neural Network for Human Activity Classification Using Millimeter-Wave Radar"
But this can only be used for reference at present for some files are write coarsly.
The ordinary project is on another computer and I can't use it because of the SARS-CoV-2.
I will then perfect it as soon as possible.
If you have any questions, please contact me.
